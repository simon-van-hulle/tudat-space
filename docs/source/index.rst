Tudat Space
======================================


Tudat is a platform and community for astrodynamics and space research.
Our mission is to provide educators, researchers, students, and
enthusiasts access to a powerful toolkit, fuelling careers and
passions in astrodynamics and space. 

..
	Just a number of the key features of Tudat are the following: 

	- **Modular propagation** of orbital dynamics 

	  - Simulation the ascent of a space plane, or all planets in the solar system, using the same interfaces
	  - Swap out environment and acceleration models to smoothly go from preliminary design to high-fidelity models
	  - Use custom models (implemented in Python or C++) for guidance systems, or models not (yet) in Tudat    

	- **Concurrent propagation** of the coupled dynamics of any number of bodies 
	  
	  - Propagate the orbit and attitude dynamics of a spacecraft, re-entry vehicle or space plane
	  - Propagate the coupled dynamics of a natural satellite system, including the possibility for rotational dynamics
	  - Propagate dynamics and variational equations for any type of dynamics

	- **Simulated state estimation** using a wide variety of tracking data and parameters
	  
	  - From high-accuracy Mars gravity field determination, to coupled spacecraft-natural-body dynamics estimation
	  - Fuse radio tracking data, astrometric data, and other data types for either a covariance analysis or a full simulated estimation
	  - Single-arc, multi-arc, or a combination of the tow

	- **Estimation from real data** under active development! Coming soon:
	  
	  - Spacecraft orbit determination from DSN radio tracking data
	  - Processing of Minor Planet Center data for minor solar system body estimation  
	  - Incorporation of Planetary Radio Interferometry and Doppler Experiment (PRIDE) data into an estimation       

	- Perform **preliminary interplanetary transfer** trajectory design with patched conic methods   
	- All model **implementation in C++**, all **interfaces in Python**, using the pybind11 library
	- Extensively verified by **more than 200 unit tests**
	- Used as the core tool for **more than 20 peer-reviewed articles**, and more than 100 M.Sc. thesis projects
	- An extensive `API desription <https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/>`_
	- Everything **open-source**!



What is Tudat?
===========================================

The TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox (Tudat) is a powerful set of libraries that support astrodynamics and space research.
Such framework can be used for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from the study of reentry dynamic to interplanetary
missions. The functionality of Tudat is implemented in C++, but a Python interface, called Tudatpy, is now available,
through which the core simulation functionality can be accessed. Tudat and Tudatpy are disseminated as conda packages;
to get started with them, have a look at our
:ref:`installation guide<getting_started_installation>`.
